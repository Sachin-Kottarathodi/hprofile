Hello, I’m Sachin Kottarathodi, and this is my personal page.

I am a technology professional specializing in building scalable distributed systems. I am deeply interested in distributed architectures, data-intensive systems, databases, clean code practices, and design patterns — with a strong emphasis on applying these principles pragmatically to solve real-world problems. I have a proven track record of delivering impactful business solutions, with a focus on designing maintainable and high-performance systems. My experience working with engineers across varied backgrounds has strengthened my ability to mentor, collaborate, and drive technical excellence within teams.

Beyond architecture and system design, I enjoy hands-on coding and debugging, staying close to code and systems to strengthen both technical depth and decision-making. While I thrive under pressure and responsibility, I am equally committed to maintaining a balanced approach to work and life, ensuring sustainable high performance over the long term.

I enjoy reading across a wide range of topics — from fiction and psychology to investment strategies. Reading helps me relax and often feels like stepping into another world, offering both a break from routine and new ways to look at things. 
I also enjoy writing, though I often find it easier to start than to finish. You might come across a few unfinished posts on my blog, but I find that sharing ideas — even incomplete ones — keeps them alive and makes it easier for me to revisit and finish them later.
Over time, I've also developed a strong interest in investments and financial thinking. The [Books]({{< ref "hugo-gallery.md" >}}) section highlights some of the titles that have shaped my views.
I appreciate value in simplicity — long walks, quiet time, and keeping life uncluttered, both in work and outside of it.
