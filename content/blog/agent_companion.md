## **Agent Companion**

An *Agent* is an application designed to achieve specific objectives by perceiving its environment and acting strategically using available tools. The core principle of an agent is its integration of reasoning, logic, and external information accessâ€”allowing it to make decisions beyond the base modelâ€™s capabilities. These agents operate autonomously, pursuing goals proactively and determining subsequent actions without step-by-step instructions.

## **ðŸ”§ AgentOps & GenAIOps Continuum**

AgentOps concerns the operationalization of agents. It involves:

- Tool management (internal & external)  
- Agent Brain Prompt: goal, profile, and instructions  
- Orchestration and Memory management  
- Task decomposition and execution flow  

**Core Capabilities:**

- Version control, automated CI/CD deployments  
- Unit/integration testing and logging  
- Security, authentication, secret management  
- Metrics, throttling, quotas, exception handling  
- Scalability and privacy compliance  

Tech stack evolution:

- **DevOps** is about operationalizing deterministic applications via people, process, and technology.  
- **MLOps** extends DevOps to model-based, *non-deterministic* outputs powered by data.  
- **FMOps** adds foundation model management and fine-tuning workflows.  
- **PromptOps** handles prompt lineage, storage, templating, optimization, and evaluation.  
- **RAGOps** manages retrieval pipelines: chunking, vectorization, ranking, and grounding.  
- **AgentOps** orchestrates agents with memory, toolsets, goal-driven logic, and task routing.  

High-fidelity Ops implementations also reflect organizational structure and customer workflow.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics & Evaluation**

**Agent Success Metrics:**

| Metric                   | Description                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Goal Completion Rate     | Tracks completion per task within a goal              |
| Trace Events             | Logs every internal agent decision and action         |
| Success / Failure Rates  | Measures and diagnoses outcomes                       |
| Human-in-the-loop        | Evaluates human oversight and interaction quality     |

**Evaluation Dimensions:**

1. **Agent Capabilities:** Tool calling, reasoning, planning. Benchmarks like BFCL and Ï„-bench evaluate function calling and plan execution.
2. **Trajectory Evaluation:** Compares predicted tool-call sequences to ground truth. Metrics include:
   - Exact Match (strict)
   - Ordered Match (core steps in order, flexible extras)
   - Any Order (all steps regardless of sequence)
   - Precision, Recall, and Single-tool usage
3. **Response Evaluation:** A final output assessed by an *auto-rater LLM* acting as a judge, based on defined criteria.

For **multi-agent systems**, evaluate:
- Cooperation and coordination
- Planning and task assignment effectiveness
- Agent utilization and operational scaling

## **ðŸ§© Multi-Agent Topologies & Roles**

Common agent types:

- **Planner Agents**: Decompose high-level goals into structured sub-tasks  
- **Retriever Agents**: Perform dynamic data fetching  
- **Execution Agents**: Generate responses or invoke APIs  
- **Evaluator Agents**: Validate output coherence and quality  

Topology choices:
- Single agent, network, supervisor, hierarchical, or customized  
- System architectures can be sequential, collaborative, competitive, or layered

Key components:

- Interactive wrapper, memory management (short + long term)  
- Cognitive subsystem (CoT, ReAct, planning)  
- Tool integration (registries), routing, delegation  
- Feedback loops, reinforcement learning  
- Agent-to-agent communication and persistence layers

## **ðŸ§ª Agentic RAG Workflow**

Key steps before agent introduction:

- Document ingestion 
- Metadata extraction, embeddings, vector DB setup  
- Similarity search, re-ranking, grounding prompts
