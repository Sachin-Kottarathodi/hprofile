## but only when Marketing is done with intent...

I’ve bought things.
Hired people.
Paid for services.

Not because they chased me.
But because they told me who they were.
What they do.
What they offer.

I checked reviews. I saw their work.
I decided based on what they made visible.

Imagine if they stayed silent.
Too “humble” to speak.
Too “pure” to sell.

I’d never have known.
They’d never have helped.

We throw shade at marketing.
Call it fake, flashy, manipulative.
And yes, some of it is.
Endorsements by celebrities who don’t use what they sell.
Influencers pushing what they don’t believe in.

But visibility isn’t vanity. It’s reach.
It’s service. It’s saying: “I can help. And here’s how.”
It’s not about being loud.
It’s about being available.

If you believe you bring value —
Then not putting yourself out there isn’t modesty.
It’s withholding.

Visibility is how service scales.
And silence doesn’t serve anyone.
