## Perfection is a Sham

- Delayed progress  
- Analysis paralysis  
- Decision fatigue  
- Brain rot  
- Sunk cost  
- The elephant that forgot it could move  
- Lost motivation  
- Burnout  
- Discontentment  

> *“Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”*

And still, perfection is sought.  
Craved. Chased. Worshipped.

Why?

Because perfection is a shield.  
A shield against criticism.  
A way to avoid failure.  
A distraction from fear.  
A justification to not even begin —  
because unless it’s perfect, why try at all?

So we choose nothing over something.  
Abandon the imperfect.  
Delay the in-progress.  
Until nothing is done, and everything remains untouched.

But the critics don’t disappear.  
The fear doesn’t vanish.  
The pressure only builds.  
The burnout deepens.

And perfection?  
It becomes more than a standard.  
It becomes a mindset.  
A habit.  
A spiraling rut that’s hard to escape.

## The Way Out

It takes time. And practice.  
Not to lower the bar —  
but to **release yourself** from holding everything to it.

Not to self - Start by:
- Doing things without holding them against yourself  
- Making progress without demanding completion  
- Being okay with the incomplete, when completeness isn’t needed  
- Prioritizing what’s necessary — not what perfection demands  
- Being able to stop logically, and pick it up later if it matters

This isn’t mediocrity.  
This is momentum.  
This is reclaiming the joy of *doing* — without the burden of *flawless.*

Because **done imperfectly** moves you forward.  
**Perfect but undone** doesn’t.
