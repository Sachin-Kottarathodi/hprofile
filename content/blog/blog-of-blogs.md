## Growth Map - Non Checklist

ðŸ”­ Concepts to Explore Later
## Hybrid Search (Sparse + Dense Retrieval)
Combine traditional keyword search (like TF-IDF/BM25) with embeddings for better relevance, especially in enterprise search.

## Vector Databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus)
Each has trade-offs in latency, scalability, and integrations. Worth exploring for hands-on projects.

## Document Chunking Strategies
How to split large docs into semantically meaningful chunks before embedding â€” affects RAG accuracy.

## Embedding Refresh and Drift
What happens when your source data changes? Techniques to manage stale embeddings in evolving systems.

## Cross-Lingual / Multilingual Embeddings
Use models like LASER, LaBSE, or XLM-R to handle multilingual queries and documents in the same vector space.
