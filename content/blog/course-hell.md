# Course Hell

Everything has a course.  
No course is enough.  

Take one, finish it, and before you try doing anything, jump onto another.  
Because why? Obligation!

## The Trap

We start to believe:  
> *Learning means doing courses.*  

Wrong.  

Learning without an outlet is like flooding your home with the faucet left on.  
Overflow & Noise. Drowning in theory.

## No Course Hell

Basic is enough.  
Then jump onto doing.  

What’s important?  
To know what to do.

## The Way Out

1. **Scope it out** — define the smallest possible thing you can build.  
2. **Start small** — no shame in being rough at the start.  
3. **Make it work** — focus on functionality before polish.  
4. **Spend time setting up** — tools, environment, workflows. This is the real investment.  
5. **Build over it. Build like hell.**
