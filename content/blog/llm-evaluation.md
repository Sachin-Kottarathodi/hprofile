# Evaluation of LLM Applications

#Critical decisions 

- **model selection**
- **prompts**
- **data augmentation**
- **performance monitoring**. 

A key concern is understanding how a model performs **within the application’s context** and how well it meets anticipated **usage patterns**.

## Building a Robust Evaluation Dataset

- **Manual Seeding**: Start by manually crafting data points using domain expertise to ensure **relevance** and **diversity**.
- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Enrich the dataset with **real user interactions** and **production logs** as your application evolves.
- **Synthetic Data**: Leverage LLMs to generate **synthetic edge cases** and underrepresented scenarios.

> Establishing precise criteria that reflect real-world outcomes is essential for meaningful evaluation.

## Key Evaluation Principles for LLM-Powered Applications

1. **Data is the Foundation**  
   Create a dataset that mirrors **actual application usage**. Continuously improve it using **feedback loops**. Remember:
   > Garbage in, garbage out — evaluation quality is only as good as the data it's based on.

2. **Evaluate Beyond the Model**  
   LLMs operate as part of a system. Evaluation should include:

    - Prompt engineering strategies
    - Data augmentation methods
    - Intermediate reasoning steps
    - End-to-end workflow evaluation

3. **Precisely Define “Good”**  
   Avoid generic metrics. Instead:

    - Define success criteria **tailored to your use case**
    - Use **task-specific rubrics** for more effective feedback

## Evaluation Strategies

### Evaluation Types

- **Point-wise Evaluation**: Rate individual model outputs.
- **Pair-wise Evaluation**: Compare two outputs and decide which is better.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation Pipeline

1. **Establish Metrics**
2. **Design Rubrics**

    - **Rating** (Quantitative)
    - **Rationale** (Qualitative)

## Automated vs Human Evaluation

### Computation-Based Metrics

- **Lexical Similarity**
    - `ROUGE` (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
    - `BLEU` (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)
- **Embedding Similarity**
    - `BERT`, `BART` embedding comparisons

### Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation

#### Autoraters and Meta-Evaluation

LLM-based autoraters can be used but need **bias calibration**. Techniques include:

- **Prompt Engineering & Orchestration**: Design precise evaluation prompts.
- **Swapping Positions**: Mitigate position bias by randomizing response order.
- **Self-Consistency Checks**: Generate multiple outputs for the same input.
- **Model Juries**: Use a **panel of diverse models** to reduce individual bias.
- **De-biasing Datasets**: Fine-tune autoraters on curated evaluation data.

## Example Enum 

```python
class SummaryRating(enum.Enum):
    VERY_GOOD = '5'
    GOOD = '4'
    OK = '3'
    BAD = '2'
    VERY_BAD = '1'

structured_output_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
    response_mime_type="text/x.enum",
    response_schema=SummaryRating,
)
```

## Pairwise Evaluation Prompt Example

```python
QA_PAIRWISE_PROMPT = """# Instruction
You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of responses from two AI models.

# Evaluation
## Metric Definition
Evaluate based on instruction following, groundedness, completeness, and fluency.

## Rating Rubric
"A" - Response A is better  
"B" - Response B is better  
"SAME" - Both are equal

## Evaluation Steps
1. Analyze Response A
2. Analyze Response B
3. Compare both responses
4. Output "A", "B", or "SAME"
5. Provide explanation for your choice

# User Prompt
{prompt}

# Response A
{baseline_model_response}

# Response B
{response}
"""
```

## Final Thoughts

Evaluation of LLM systems is **multi-dimensional**. Good metrics, data quality, prompt design, and monitoring mechanisms all contribute to making systems reliable, interpretable, and aligned with end-user goals.
