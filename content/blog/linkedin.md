This is not what I thought my first blog would be about on my site. I was sure it was going to be about tech — perhaps a book summary.
But I’m not going to restrict myself. This is my space, after all. So here it goes.

# What's happened to LinkedIn?

Seriously, LinkedIn is filled with so much humble bragging, pointless posts, and surrogate marketing.
The good old "HR meets candidates" platform is now a full-blown social network. Everyone seems to have sudden epiphanies — some insightful, others... well, less so. Here’s one: learning about customer obsession from a street-side peanut vendor.

And what's with people finding absolute nonsense and calling it a unique perspective?
Okay, that's one perspective.

Reels on LinkedIn was the final nail, I promptly uninstalled the app on my phone. I have wanted to be active, but now it's just another instagram-like place.

Nothing I say comes close to how well it depicts in the video. Welcome to hell on earth.

# The Flip Side

That said, what's the alternative? This is about careers and business after all. LinkedIn or not, we live in a make-believe world where promoting one’s interests is the norm.

In a world where everyone is fighting for the same piece of the pie, visibility and brand creation are essential skills. It's no longer about who did what - though that helps - it's more about how many people saw it, shared it, spoke about it.

It's the difference between a critically acclaimed movie and a money-minting blockbuster.
It's the difference between an Amazon listing with few reviews and one with hundreds.

It's not fair, but it's real.

Does that mean a blockbuster cannot be critically acclaimed or that listings with many reviews are all fakes? of course not. But it *does* make it harder to succeed on substance alone - hoping for accidental word for mouth.
And here's the kicker. Even word of mouth is just another post. 

Authenticity is rare, it takes integrity to be authentic in the world where performative success often overshadows the quiet substance. 

This is not about weeding out the clown show or scrutinizing every post out there, no one has the time or energy - hats off to those who do.

It is about that individual - who watches the world march ahead with changing times, left stranded on an island of beliefs. 

Breaking the cufflink is often the hardest part- especially when **you hold the keys yourself**.

Taking action - that aligns with one's principles - allows for progress and satisfaction. The outcome is unknown, but staying put is not an option.


# What's all this about

A rant on what's happened to LinkedIn. 
An acceptance that this is what the landscape looks like now.
A possibility of being part of the show - doing it on your own terms.

With integrity. Without compromising authenticity. 
Walk alongside the crowd -- just do it your way!

Note to self - Show up. Speak up. Stay true.
