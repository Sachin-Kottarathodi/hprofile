This is not what I thought my first blog would be about on my site. I was sure it was going to be about tech. Perhaps, a book summary. But I am not going to restrict myself, this is my space after all. So here it goes.


# What would I really post about?

Seriously, LinkedIn is filled with so much humble brag, pointless posts, surrogate publicity. 
The good old HR meets candidates place is now a full blown social network with everyone having sudden epiphanies which makes me want to pull my hair out - learning about customer obsession from street side peanut vendor or similar. And what's with people being able to find absolute non-sense as interesting perspectives? Who are people brown nosing to?

Reels on LinkedIn was the nail in the coffin for me, I promptly uninstalled the app on my phone. I have wanted to be active, but now it's just another instagram like place.

Nothing I say comes close to how well it depicts in the video. Welcome to hell on earth.
