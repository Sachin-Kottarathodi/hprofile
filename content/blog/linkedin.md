**This wasn't meant to be my first post. But I wanted to start with something real.**

# What's happened to LinkedIn?

Seriously, LinkedIn is overflowing with humble brags, pointless posts, and thinly veiled marketing.
The good old "HR meets candidates" platform is now a full-blown social network. Everyone seems to have sudden epiphanies — some insightful, others... well, less so. Here’s one: learning about customer obsession from a street-side peanut vendor.

And what's with people finding absolute nonsense content and calling them "unique perspectives"?
Okay, that's one perspective.
Reels on LinkedIn were the final nail. I promptly uninstalled the app from my phone. I wanted to be active, but now it just feels like another Instagram clone.

Nothing I say comes close to how well it depicts in the video. Welcome to hell on earth.

# The Flip Side

That said, what's the alternative? This is about careers and business after all. LinkedIn or not, we live in a make-believe world where promoting one’s interests is the norm.

In a world where everyone is fighting for the same piece of the pie, visibility and personal branding have become essential skills. It’s no longer just about what you did — though that helps — it’s more about how many people saw it, shared it, talked about it.

It's the difference between a critically acclaimed movie and a money-minting blockbuster.
It's the difference between an Amazon listing with few reviews and one with hundreds.

It's not fair, but it's real.

Does that mean a blockbuster cannot be critically acclaimed or that listings with many reviews are all fakes? of course not. But it *does* make it harder to succeed on substance alone - hoping for accidental word for mouth.
And here's the kicker. LinkedIn has become the go-to platform for word of mouth as well. 

Authenticity is rare, it takes integrity to be authentic in the world where performative success often overshadows the quiet substance. 

This is not about weeding out the clown show or scrutinizing every post out there, no one has the time or energy - hats off to those who do.

It is about that individual - who watches the world march ahead with changing times, left stranded on an island of beliefs. 

Taking action - that aligns with one's principles - allows for progress and satisfaction. The outcome is unknown, but staying put is not an option.


# What's all this about

A rant on what's happened to LinkedIn. 
An acceptance of the current landscape.
A possibility of being part of the show - doing it on your own terms.

With integrity. Without compromising authenticity.
 
Note to self - Show up. Speak up. Stay true.
