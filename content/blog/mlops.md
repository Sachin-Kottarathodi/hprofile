## GenAI Stack Components

| Layer               | Vertex Component(s)                        | Represents                          | Takeaway                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discover            | Model Garden                               | Multi-modal model sourcing           | Support for various modalities (Text, Vision, etc.) is essential         |
| Prototype           | Notebooks, Studio, Colab                   | Safe and collaborative R&D           | Allow fast iteration and experimentation before committing to scale     |
| Customize           | Training, Feature Store, Experiments       | Fine-tuning, embedding, model tuning | Domain-specific model improvements need feature/embedding pipelines     |
| Orchestrate         | Vertex Pipelines                           | Workflow automation                  | Seamless orchestration of LLM workflows, agents, or data pipelines       |
| Augment & Chain     | Grounding, RAG, Extensions, Agent Builder  | Retrieval-augmented generation stack | Ground responses with verifiable data and enable external tool usage     |
| Experiment          | TensorBoard, Experiments                   | Model evaluation & diagnostics       | Measure model behavior with reproducible experiments and visual tools    |
| Predict & Serve     | Endpoints, Vector Search                   | Scalable deployment and retrieval    | Enable low-latency LLM and embedding-backed services for production use  |
| Govern              | Model Registry, Dataplex                   | Compliance and observability         | Ensure traceability, auditability, versioning, and access control        |
